# Borrowed Licensing Information

The following files were written by Makeblock as a part of their Crab Walk example:

 - src/MeCollisionSensor.cpp
 - src/MeCollisionSensor.h
 - src/MeNewRGBLed.cpp

 These files might be modified from their original source. If they were modified, those modifications were custom-made by the owners of this project; git blame is a great tool.
